    $ cd fleakr
    $ rake gem && sudo gem install pkg/fleakr-<version>.gem

== Usage

Before doing anything, require the library:

    >> require 'rubygems'
    >> require 'fleakr'

Then, set your API key (only need to do this once per session):

    >> Fleakr.api_key = '<your api key here>'
    
Find a user by username:

    >> user = Fleakr.user('the decapitator')
    => #<Fleakr::Objects::User:0x692648 @username="the decapitator", @id="21775151@N06">

Or by email:

    >> user = Fleakr.user('user@host.com')
    => #<Fleakr::Objects::User:0x11f484c @username="bckspcr", @id="84481630@N00">

Once you have a user, you can find his associated sets:

    >> user.sets
    => [#<Fleakr::Objects::Set:0x671358 @title="The Decapitator", @description="">, 
        #<Fleakr::Objects::Set:0x66d898 @title="londonpaper hijack", ...

Or contacts:

    >> user.contacts.first
    => #<Fleakr::Objects::User:0x19039bc @username=".schill",
        @id="12289718@N00", @icon_farm="1", @icon_server="4">

Or groups if you would like:
    
    >> user.groups
    => [#<Fleakr::Objects::Group:0x11f2330 ..., 
        #<Fleakr::Objects::Group:0x11f2308 ...
    >> user.groups.first.name
    => "Rural Decay"
    >> user.groups.first.id
    => "14581414@N00"

Groups also contain photos:

    >> u.groups.last.photos.first.title
    => "Welcome To The Machine"

When accessing a set, you can also grab all the photos that are in that set:

    >> user.sets.first
    => #<Fleakr::Objects::Set:0x1195bbc @title="The Decapitator", @id="72157603480986566", @description="">
    >> user.sets.first.photos.first
    => #<Fleakr::Objects::Photo:0x1140108 ... >
    >> user.sets.first.photos.first.title
    => "Untitled1"
    
If a photo interests you, save it down to a directory of your choosing:

    >> user.sets.first.photos.first.small.save_to('/tmp')
    => #<File:/tmp/2117922283_715587b2cb_m.jpg (closed)>
    
If you can't decide on a photo and would rather just save the whole set, specify the target directory 
and the size of the images you're interested in:

    >> user.sets.first.save_to('/tmp', :square)
    => [#<Fleakr::Objects::Photo:0x1187a1c @secret="715587b2cb" ...
    >> Dir["/tmp/#{user.sets.first.title}/*.jpg"].map
    => ["/tmp/The Decapitator/2117919621_8b2d601bff_s.jpg", 
        "/tmp/The Decapitator/2117921045_5fb15eff90_s.jpg", 
        "/tmp/The Decapitator/2117922283_715587b2cb_s.jpg", ...

If you would prefer to just search photos, you can do that with search text:

    >> photos = Fleakr.search('ponies!!')
    => [#<Fleakr::Objects::Photo:0x11f4e64 @title="hiroshima atomic garden", @id="3078234390">, 
        #<Fleakr::Objects::Photo:0x11f4928 @title="PONYLOV", @id="3077360853">, ...
    >> photos.first.title
    => "hiroshima atomic garden"

You can also search based on tags:

    >> photos = Fleakr.search(:tags => 'macro')
    >> photos.first.title
    => "Demure"
    >> photos.first.id
    => "3076049945"

Searches can also be scoped to other entities in the system (namely Users and Groups):

    >> user.groups.first.search('awesome')
    => [#<Fleakr::Objects::Photo:0x18cb4cc @server_id="2012", @id="2181921273",
         @farm_id="3", @title="", @secret="634eda7521">, ... 
    >> user.search('serpent')
    => [#<Fleakr::Objects::Photo:0x18a6960 @server_id="41", @id="81370156",
        @farm_id="1", @title="Clear and Serpent Danger", @secret="013091582a">]
        
== TODO

* Implement remaining bits of person, photoset, and photo-releated APIs
* Provide a better searching interface
* Lazily load attributes for objects that need to be accessed via secondary API call
